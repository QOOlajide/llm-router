## 🚀 What is Analogy.AI?

**Analogy.AI** is an AI-powered learning tool that helps users retain complex or technical concepts by turning them into **personalized analogies**. Whether you're a student learning cloud computing or a professional exploring new frameworks, Analogy.AI reframes abstract ideas using examples relevant to your lifestyle, interests, or background.

The platform supports both **text and video** output, and is designed to integrate with tools like Notion, GitHub, and your calendar to passively suggest analogies based on what you're currently working on.

## 🧠 Long-Term Vision

This MVP is just the beginning. Here's the full vision for Analogy.AI:

- ✅ **User input:** Enter a topic (e.g., "IAM policies" or "Next.js routing")
- ✅ **Output format:** Choose between text or video
- 🛠️ **MCP Integration:** A Model-Context Protocol server that passively detects what you’re working on across tools like Notion, GitHub, and Google Calendar
- 🔄 **Reinforcement layer:** Resurface analogies through spaced repetition or quizzes
- 📚 **Personal dashboard:** Save, organize, and review all your analogies in one place
- 📤 **Delivery options:** Get analogies sent through Slack, email, or in-app notifications
